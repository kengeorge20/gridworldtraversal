How to Run:

python generate_gridworld.py (if gridworlds folder was deleted, should not be)
python gridworld_viewer.py

We've provided generated gridworlds for use, but for another set of 50 grids, please delete the gridworld folders if you've instantiated it yourself. Display a grid, and then select the algorithm to visualize (important to display first), details about the agent's traversal through the grid is detailed in the terminal.
